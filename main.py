# Welcome to the Data-Drivenness Assessment Tool

This interactive tool helps you evaluate how data-driven your department is across six key dimensions:
culture, alignment, capabilities, leadership, access, and utilization.

You’ll be guided through:
1. A short diagnostic questionnaire  
2. A radar chart visualizing your results  
3. A summary of which dimensions may need attention  
4. A tip on how to improve
